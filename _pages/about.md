**About me**  
During the day, I apply machine Learning research to industry problems at [Fusemachines](https://fusemachines.com). At the night, I am batman .. Wish it were that exciting. I usually like to take a walk, listen to podcasts, ruminate on stuffs. Literally I can be wasting whole week watching 5 mins explanation of how exactly a electricity flows, and sometimes things are more concrete like writing code to visualize interseting algorithms.
Basically, I like thinking.

**Interest Areas**  

More I have grown over these years, wider the realm of topics that excite me has become. As a thirteen year old who loved watching nat-geo and discovery without getting half of things they said, my interests has osciallated everywhere from building crazy gadgets in my backyard to understanding more about the origin of everything. My current self has grown interest over building algorithms that can build world knowledge and "evolve" to solve problems like humans, cat, dog e.t.c. And no, my limits are only to the replicating problem solving ability of humans and animals in digital space. No way I would want to wander questioning on the hard porblem of consiousness. Although I would place my bet on conciousness being a by-product of being a good general problem solver. 

Naturally, this has led me towards understanding the process of cognitive-evolution itself. Just a drive to self-replicate leading to current version of us is fascinating. How most of the seemingly super-complex phenomenona originate from a simple rule; whether it's newton's law that nearly-accurately predicts the motion of heavenly bodies, to darwin's idea of everything origination from a self-replication molecule, I am hopeful no possibility of somewhat simple, meta-learning algorithm that could crack the code of general problem solving capabilities seen mostly in mammals. 

As of now, Deep learning particularly excites me because of it's design flexibility and the ability to become better with Data.  


**About this blog**
This blog is about documenting holistic explanation on different ideas, mostly related around Machine learning and software engineering.
