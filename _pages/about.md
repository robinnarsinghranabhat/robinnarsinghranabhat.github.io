**Who I am**  
It doesn't matter much. What matters is what I do. [wide and deep](https://github.com/robinnarsinghranabhat) on the world to visualize maths.

**What I do**  
I apply Machine Learning research to industry problems at [Fusemachines](https://fusemachines.com) . I've worked in domains of education, health-care, logistics and market research.

**Interest Areas**  
Well I feel like current AI hype is going downhill. With the problems it's solving, whether is game of go or playing robot playing Rubix cube, are in all, limited to specific boundaries. I believe real learning isn't anywhere near replicated by firing of neurons. But way deeper. It's being monitored by unimaginably complex chemical interaction at cellular level.
Since all the evidence regarding biological evolution point towards an chemical event giving rise to an self replicating molecule that would copy itself as well as it's properties  ( well, earth was hot and thundering back then, and molecules self replication is assumed to be an act of releasing excess energy) .

Well, I am searching on how this complex chemical interaction forged into free will, of that I am conscious of .


**About this blog**
This blog is about me portraying intuitive feels on different mathematical ideas, mostly related around Machine learning, that I find interesting.
