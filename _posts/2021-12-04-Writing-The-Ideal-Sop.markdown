As as machine learning engineer trying applying for Graduate school, I decided to curate my most important findings and save tons of time for anyone. That' my contribution to delaying the heat death of the universe.

### What MIT [EECS Depertment](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/graduate-programs/) Professors Look for in an ideal Statement of Purpose Letter for a PhD programme ?

( TLDR )
- What genuinely interests the student and clarity of presenting the ideas in the SOP ?
- Prior Research Experience around students field, ideas he wants to explore, and Letter of Recommendation. Helps if both the professors Statement of Letter concide.
- Ability to take initiatives and come in with new ideas to explore
- How well students research intersets align with the professors
